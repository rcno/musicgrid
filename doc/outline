Grid of music metadata for quick and simple tag and playlist editing.

xx Use MPD for database.
    Alternate backend: filesystem. Read a folder.

Rows: single file.
Columns: tags. Choose from presets, and define arbitrary.
    Use regexp, combine tags, how to deal with ambiguity?

Sort any column. Sort preserves order of equivalent rows.

Collapse equivalent rows. Lightweight margin display of tree structure.

Filter. On anything, or on specified fields.
    Full regexp and truth function support.

Select/deselect -- both replace & append.

Replace/append active col on all rows.
Undo.

When to write to file rather than db? Defer to mpd?

Use haskell & gtk / qtquick
    Network.MPD
    Graphics.UI.Gtk (gtk2hs) or Graphics.QML (hsqml)
